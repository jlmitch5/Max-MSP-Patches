Feel free to use and edit this stuff in any way you see fit.  I appreciate feedback (which you can do by opening an issue, if you aren't familiar with github).  Note that additional functionality or just links to how you've changed it can count as "issues" :).

**Width Delay** - A width controllable delay.  I used some of [Joshua Casper's source](http://www.joshuacasper.com/max-4-live-tutorials/max-4-live-tutorial-making-a-very-simple-delay-v-2/) for making the delay sync to Ableton's tempo.  I also refactored the idea from this [tutorial video](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QtwIwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dmi9CjZxk8zs&ei=NAh5VKOsI4SgNt6Ag-gO&usg=AFQjCNEB8V-8VHzuWTQ2p1vhoCQlVX61Zw&sig2=_B7Wadl5l-OVY-z6eAowNA&bvm=bv.80642063,d.eXY) for setting up the width knob.
